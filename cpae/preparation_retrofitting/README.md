We provide a script that reads a json dictionary and that outputs a lexicon readable by the retrofitting code, available [here](https://github.com/mfaruqui/retrofitting). To run the tool:

`python lexiconize.py ../data/en_wn_full/all_not_merged.json retrofitting_lexicon_WN_defs.txt`

Note that we also provide a modified version of retrofitting, with a corrected bug and more options.
