# CPAE Bias Measurement

This is a project for [CS230](cs230.stanford.edu) aimed at measuring the amount of bias present in a dictionary-derived formulation of word embeddings.
More specifically, this attempts to measure the gender bias present in Tom Bosc and Pascal Vincent's [CPAE](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1181.pdf) and see how it compares to other word embeddings derived from less structured corpora.
