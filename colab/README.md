# Google Colab Notebooks

Because I don't want to spend money, most of my training was done on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which isn't a fun time to be honest.
This is an archive of the notebooks I used to train my CPAE embeddings.
I'm not sure if you can just open them in Jupyter, or import them back into Google Colab, but hopefully they turn out to be helpful.
